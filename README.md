# Bangalore House Price Prediction
 ### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryanfelix/bangalore-housing-prices
 
The Bangalore House Price Prediction project is a comprehensive solution leveraging Python-based tools and technologies to predict house prices in various neighborhoods of Bangalore. The project involves data cleaning and exploration using Numpy and Pandas, visualization of key insights with Matplotlib, and the development of a machine learning model using Scikit-learn. The model is trained on a dataset containing diverse features such as location, size, amenities, and more, enabling accurate predictions of house prices.

## Key Features:
### 1.Data Cleaning and Exploration:
Utilizes Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning and exploration.
Handles missing values, outliers, and ensures the dataset is well-prepared for model training.

### 2.Data Visualization:
Matplotlib is employed to create insightful visualizations for housing data.

### 3.Machine Learning Model:
Scikit-learn is used for building a robust machine learning model.
The model is trained on historical housing data to predict prices based on various input features.

### 4.Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
Development is carried out using popular IDEs including Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm.

### 5.Web Application Development:
Python Flask is employed as the HTTP server to serve the machine learning model.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create an intuitive and user-friendly web interface for users to input property details and receive predicted house prices.
