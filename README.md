# Bangalore House Price Prediction
 ### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryanfelix/bangalore-housing-prices
In this project  predict the Bangalore House Price and  build a sample website . In this i  first build a model using sklearn and linear regression  and other machine leaning models . I write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests and the   website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building i undergo concepts  such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. we use tools and technology as follows

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
